== Introduction

=== About the Application
*Horo* is a command-line interface scheduling application. It helps the user maintain a to-do list and a calendar, and posts timely reminders on their desktop.

=== Purpose
This guide specifies the architecture and software design decisions for Horo, and instructions for building upon the current codebase. This is done in hopes of ensuring extensibility and maintainability of Horo for both current and future developers.

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Main structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is contains 3 main view parts - `CalendarPanel`, `ListPanel`, `LogPanel`. It also holds several other UI parts e.g. `PopUpPanel` and `Command Box`. Every one of the UI classes will abstract from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework, and layout of these UI parts are defined in `.fxml` files which are found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. One example of the layout would be: link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`], whose FXML link is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]




The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user two different types commands using the `Logic` component.
** One command, when executed, affect the actual Events.
** The other command is executed to change the view of the UI. There are currently 3 main views in the application: `CalendarPanel`, `ListPanel`, `LogPanel`.
* It listens for any changes in the list of events using a listener:  link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/listeners/EventListListener.java[`EventListListener`].
* It also listens for the output to the user with another listener: link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listeners/UserOutputListener.java[`UserOutputListener`].

==== Calendar UI View

.Structure of the Calendar UI View
image::UiCalendarClassDiagram.png[]

The Calendar View is made up of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/CalendarPanel.java[`CalendarPanel`], which holds several different other UI parts linked together to form the overall UI. In the Calendar View, it displays two UI parts of the Calendar: `CalendarScreen` and `TimelineView`.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/CalendarScreen.java[`CalendarScreen`] is the screen which displays the calendar of a certain month and year to the user. It contains 6 x 7 instance of `CalendarGridDay`, which displays the days of the month.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineView.java[`TimelineView`] is the screen which displays the timeline using 3 different classes which abstract from `TimelineView`.

* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineDayView.java[`TimelineDayView`] displays the timeline of a particular day in a certain month and year.
* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineWeekView.java[`TimelineWeekView`] displays the timeline of a particular week. The week is according to the `CalendarScreen`, where each row represents a week of a month.
* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineMonthView.java[`TimelineMonthView`] displays the timeline of a particular month in a certain year.

Each of these timeline will hold up to a certain amount of `CardHolder` depending on the type of `TimelineView`. Each of these `CardHolder` will then hold an amount of EventCards for displaying the event name and date.

==== List UI View

.Structure of the List UI View
image::UiListClassDiagram.png[]

The List View is made up of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/list/ListPanel.java[`ListPanel`] which contains two lists views, `EventListView` and `TaskListView`

* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/list/EventListView.java[`EventListView`] displays the list of Events containing every piece of information of the Events.

* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/list/TaskListView.java[`TaskListView`] displays the list of Task, containing every piece of information of each Task. [__To be implemented__]

Similar to `TimelineView`, `EventListView` and `TaskListView` will contain a list of `Card`, but it will not be held in the `CardHolder`.

==== Log UI View

.Structure of the Log UI View
image::UiLogClassDiagram.png[]

The Log View is made up of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/log/LogPanel.java[`LogPanel`] which contains several instances of `LogBox`.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/log/LogBox.java[`LogBox`] displays literal information back to the user when it is called by `MainWindow` when it listens for a command.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
+
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation Details

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `UndoRedoManager`, which contains `undoStateList` - a history of `UndoRedoStates`. Each `UndoRedoState` object contains two lists: one to store `EventSources` and the other to store `TaskSources`, together representing the state of all event and task data at that point in time. UndoRedoManager also contains a `currentStateIndex`, which keeps track of the index of the `UndoRedoState` being used presently.

A key point to take note of is that `ModelManager` contains an `eventList` (a list of `EventSources`) and a `taskList` (a list of `TaskSources`), both of which cannot be reinitialized. This is because these two lists are directly in sync with the GUI; changes to these specific list instances are reflected as changes to the GUI, but changes to other copies of `EventSource` or `TaskSource` lists will not affect the GUI. Hence, the history of `UndoRedoStates` held by `UndoRedoManager` stores deep-copies of `EventSource` and `TaskSource` lists. Should there be a need to revert back to a past or future state (if undo or redo is called), these lists will retrieve their data from the appropriate copy of `UndoRedoState` in the list of duplicates.

`UndoRedoManager` also implements the following operations:

* `UndoRedoManager#commit(UndoRedoState state)` -- Adds the new state (which contains a deep-copied version of `TaskSource` and `EventSource` lists) to the `undoStateList`
* `UndoRedoManager#undo()` -- Restore `eventList` and `taskList` in `ModelManager` to their previous versions from the appropriate duplicate in `undoStateList` via an `UndoRedoListener`
* `UndoRedoManager#redo()` -- Restore `eventList` and `taskList` in `ModelManager` to their future versions from the appropriate duplicate in `undoStateList` via an `UndoRedoListener`
* `UndoRedoManager#clearFutureHistory()` -- Delete all duplicates of `UndoRedoState` that occur in `undoStateList` after the index given by the `currentStateIndex`

The `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` will interact directly with `UndoRedoManager` while other state-changing commands (such as adding or deleting tasks) will interact only with `ModelManager`.

There are three key *Listener* interfaces that help us achieve the desired undo-redo functionality:

* `EventListListener`
* `TaskListListener`
* `UndoRedoListener`

The `UndoRedoManager` implements the `EventListListener` interface’s method `onEventListChange(List<EventSource> events)` to “listen” for any changes to `ModelManager`’s `eventList`. (e.g. when an event is added or deleted) If such a change exists, it will be handled by first calling `UndoRedoManager#clearFutureHistory()`, instantiating a `UndoRedoState` with a deep-copied version of the `taskList` and the modified `eventList`, and calling `UndoRedoManager#commit(UndoRedoState state)` to commit this state. `UndoRedoManager` also implements `TaskListListener` in the same fashion, except that changes to the `taskList` are “listened” to rather than the `eventList`.

The `ModelManager` implements the `UndoRedoListener` interface’s method `onUndoRedo(UndoRedoState state)` to “listen” for any undo or redo being executed. This will be handled by updating `ModelManager`’s `eventList` and `taskList` data to match the data of the `UndoRedoState` with index `currentStateIndex` in `undoStateList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user runs the program for the first time. The `UndoRedoManager` will be initialized with the initial `undoStateList`. An `UndoRedoState` will be added to `undoStateList` and the `currentStateIndex` will point to that single `undoRedoState` in the list.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `add_event “Suntec City Computer Fair” --at “17/11/2019 12:00”`. The event will be added to `ModelManager`’s `eventList`. Then, `UndoRedoManager#onEventListChange(List<EventSource> events)` will be called (as there has been a change to the `eventList`), clearing all future states beyond the `currentStateIndex` as they are no longer useful. In this particular case, there are no future states to be cleared. Then, the modified `eventList` and `taskList` will be deep-copied and a new `UndoRedoState` containing the deep-copies will be added to `undoStateList`. The `currentStateIndex` is incremented by one to contain the index of the newly inserted undo redo state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not result in any change to `ModelManager#eventList` or `ModelManager#taskList`. Hence, there is no change to trigger the listener methods and thus no `UndoRedoState` will be saved to `undoStateList`.

Step 3. Suppose the user decides that adding the task was a mistake. He/she then executes the undo command to rectify the error. The undo command will decrement the `currentStateIndex` by one to contain the index of the previous undo redo state, thereafter triggering the `UndoRedoListener#onUndoRedo` method. This method updates `ModelManager`’s `eventList` and `taskList` data to match the data of the `UndoRedoState` with index `currentStateIndex` in `undoStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStateIndex` is 0, pointing to the initial undo redo state, then there are no previous undo redo states to restore. The undo command uses `UndoRedoManager#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[width=100%]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The redo command does the opposite — it calls `UndoRedoManager#redo()`, which increments the `currentStateIndex` by one to contain the index of the previously undone state. The `UndoRedoListener` then causes `ModelManager#eventList` and `ModelManager#taskList` to reset their data to this state’s list data.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStateIndex` is at index `undoStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest undo redo state, then there are no undone undo redo states to restore. The `redo` command uses `UndoRedoManager#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 4. The user decides to execute the command `log`. Non-state-changing commands such as `log` do not manipulate task and event data. Since no changes to `taskList` or `eventList` have been made, the listener methods will not be triggered and no `UndoRedoState` will be saved to `undoStateList`. Thus, the `undoStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

Step 5. The user executes `delete_event 1`, removing the event from `ModelManager`’s `eventList`. `UndoRedoManager#onEventListChange(List<EventSource> events)` will be called (as there has been a change to the `eventList`), purging all future states beyond the `currentStateIndex` as they are no longer useful. Then, the modified `eventList` and `taskList` will be deep-copied and a new `UndoRedoState` containing the deep-copies will be added to `undoStateList`. The `currentStateIndex` is incremented by one to contain the index of the newly inserted undo redo state.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves `EventSource` and `TaskSource` data every time a change has been made.
** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
** Cons: Performance issues may arise due to the relatively larger memory usage required.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself; inverse functions have to be implemented (if I undo the deletion of a person, it would be equivalent to adding him back to the list)
** Pros: Uses less memory as we only need to keep track of what commands have been executed and their parameters, as opposed to storing all task and event data between every change.
** Cons: Every command will have to be implemented twice, since their inverse operations will all be different. This is compounded by the fact that we have to ensure the correctness of every inverse operation individually as well.

// tag::notification[]
=== Notification System
==== Class Architecture
.Class diagram for Notification System
image::NotificationClassDiagram.png[]

The Notification System is facilitated by the  `NotificationManager`, which is found in the Logic component. Other constituent classes of the Notification System can be found in the Logic and UI components, depending on their functionality. These classes and their functionalities are listed below:

===== *Logic Classes*
Logic classes are responsible for deciding if a notification should be posted. As with other components, their functionality is accessed through the `NotificationManager` class. The `NotificationManager` class maintains a reference to a `NotificationCheckingThread` as well as a `SystemTrayCommunicator`.

The logic classes of the Notification System can be found under the `notification` package under the `Logic` component.

- The `NotificationCheckingThread` is a daemon thread that runs in parallel with the main application. It checks for new notifications to post every minute.
- The `NotificationChecker` is responsible for checking `Model` for any notifications that need to be posted.
{empty} +

===== *UI Classes*
UI classes are responsible for displaying notifications to the user.

The UI classes of the Notification System can be found under the `systemtray` package under the `ui` component.

- The `PopupListener` class is the main channel of communication between the logic and UI classes. When a notification needs to be posted, it will relay the information from the logic to UI classes.
- The `SystemTrayCommunicator` handles posting notifications and displaying the app's icon on the System Tray. It listens to the `NotificationCheckingThread` through a `PopupListener`.
- The `PopupNotification` class carries the information that will be posted to a popup notification.
- The `NotificationClickActionListener` is called when the user clicks on a popup notification.
{empty} +

==== Class Activity
As with other Manager classes, an instance of the  `NotificationManager` is created upon the starting of MainApp. The NotificationManager proceeds to initialize and run a `NotificationCheckingThread`, as well as a `SystemTrayCommunicator`. Upon being started, the `NotificationCheckingThread` will enter a `notificationCheckingLoop` by calling its method of the same name.

To give a better explanation of how the `NotificationCheckingThread` works, a single run of its loop is illustrated below:

.Sequence diagram for NotificationCheckingThread's main loop
image::NotificationCheckingLoopSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1. The `NotificationCheckingThread` calls the `NotificationChecker` to generate `PopupNotification`s through a call to `NotificationChecker#getListOfPopupNotifications()`

Step 2. For each `PopupNotification` generated by the NotificationChecker, a call to `PopupListener#notify()` is made.

Step 3. This prompts the `SystemTrayCommunicator` to post a new notification.

Step 4. The `NotificationCheckingThread` sleeps until the start of the next minute, found by the method `NotificationCheckingThread#findMillisecondsToNextMinute()`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the Notification system should run
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Running the Notification system as a separate thread in the same application
** Pros: Easier to implement and test.
** Cons: The user would have to leave the application on if they always wanted to be notified.
* **Alternative 2:** Running the Notification system as a background application
** Pros: This would allow notifications to be posted to the user's desktop even if the Horo main app were not open.
** Cons: This would require the creation of a separate application that the user would have to install on their computer. Because different Java applications are ran in different instances of Java Virtual Machines, this could vastly complicate implementation as the Notification System and the rest Horo would be unable to interact directly.

Alternative 1 was eventually chosen as it was simpler to implement and test, and remain within the initial scope of Horo's development. The application can be potentially changed to use Alternative 2 in the future.

// end::notification[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Design-Ics]]
=== Ics Component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ics/IcsParser.java[`IcsParser.java`]

The ICS component is made up of 2 main sub-components: ICS file parser, and ICS file exporter.

The file parser makes use of a custom parser that converts files with the `.ics` file extension
to `EventSource` and `TaskSource` objects in Horo.

Here is an overview of how the ICS component looks like:

image::IcsComponentDiagram.png[]

The file exporter uses the `IcsConverter` class to convert `EventSource` and `TaskSource` objects
stored in the `ModelManager` singleton object into their ICS String representations. Check out the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar[iCalendar Wiki Page] for more information on the specifications.


* Can export Horo's save data as a file
The `ICS` Component,with a `.ics` extension.
* Can import other Horo's save data from a `.ics` file.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Handling of Horo TaskSource and EventSource conversion to ICS Strings
- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Use of a separate class `IcsConverter` to convert `TaskSource` and `EventSource` objects
    their ICS string representations.

    * Pros: Adherence to Single Responsibility Principle,
        decouples `IcsExporter` from the `TaskSource` and `EventSource` classes, and keeps code reusable and scalable.
    * Cons: Not consistent with Object-Oriented Programming structure.
- **Alternative 2:** Create a common `IcsConvertible` Interface for `TaskSource` and `EventSource` to implement a `toIcsString()` function.

    * Pros: Adheres to Object-Oriented Programming structure.
    * Cons: Hard to reuse functions and modify code.

Alternative 1 was chosen eventually, as I felt that it is more important to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle
and keep all code relevant to converting objects to ICS Strings in the same class.

This further makes it easier for future debugging,
and makes adding new exportable objects a lot easier as there are common functions that can be used.

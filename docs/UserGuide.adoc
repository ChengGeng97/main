This User Guide provides documentation of *Horo*'s functionalities. Users may refer to this guide as a reference for what the application can do, as well as the commands that Horo will accept..

- Will be automatically removed from the Calendar past its due date, provided it is a non-recurring event.

* Task
- Will show up on the Calendar only if a due-date is specified.
- Can be marked as done.
- If not accomplished by its due date, will be automatically archived into an undone list.

=== Notification System
Horo will post notifications to your system tray to remind you that an event is starting or that a task is due.

Take note that Horo can only post reminders as long as the application is open. To tell if Horo is running, check that the appropriate icon appears in the system tray

.Horo tray icon
image::HoroIconScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
Also take note that notifications are switched on by default upon launch. This status is not carried over between sessions. If you would like to switch notifications off, you would have to do so whenever you start Horo up.

You can tell if notifications are switched on by mousing over the icon in the system tray.

.Mousing over the Horo tray icon
image::IconMouseOverScreenShot.png[]

=== Undo-Redo
The following commands allow you to undo and redo previously input commands.

==== Undo

.Undo Command
image::UndoCommandScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

The `undo` command undoes the previous command. +
Commands can be undone up to the program's launch.

Command Format: +
`*undo*`

{empty} +

==== Redo

.Redo Command
image::RedoCommandScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

The `redo` command redoes a previously undone command.
The `redo` command is able to redo any undone commands that have not been succeeded by a separate state-changing command (e.g. add_event, delete_event, edit).

For example, suppose you added an event `"Attend Horo's Birthday"` and ran the `undo` command, thus removing the event from Horo.
Now, if you run `redo`, the previous state of Horo before the latest `undo` command was executed will be restored;
`"Attend Horo's Birthday"` will once again appear in Horo.

However, if you had executed any state-changing command (except for `undo` or `redo`) just after undoing the `add_event` command,
calling redo will then amount to no effect.

If you've ever used another application with undo-redo functionality, just imagine that Horo's undo-redo functions are as intuitive as theirs.

Command Format: +
`*redo*`

{empty} +

=== iCalendar (ICS) Integration

Horo stores data in the ICS format. Files saved in this format have the extension `.ics`.
This allows for data to be imported to and exported from other calendar applications that also use the `.ics` format.

==== Export current calendar

.Export Command
image::ExportCommandScreenShot.png[]

.Exported File
image::ExportFileScreenShot.png[]

The `export` command exports your current calendar as an ICS file to the specified directory.
If no directory is specified, the file will be created in the same directory as Horo.

Command Format: +
`*export*` +
`*export* *--directory* DIRECTORY`

Example: +
`*export* *--directory* "C:\Users\USER_NAME\Desktop\Horo"`

{empty} +

==== Import other calendar

.Import Command
image::ImportCommandScreenShot.png[]

.Imported File
image::ImportFileScreenShot.png[]

The `import` command imports an ICS file from the specified filepath.

Command Format: +
`*import* FILEPATH`

Example: +
`*import* "C:\Users\USER_NAME\Desktop\OtherCalendars\Others.ics"`

{empty} +

Command Format: +
`*exit*`
